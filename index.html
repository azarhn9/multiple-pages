    <h1>Violin 🎻 </h1>
<p>
    The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins
    have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular
    use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most
    commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers
    (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno).
